# Agent Matching Service - Quick Start Guide

## 🎯 What is it?

The Agent Matching Service intelligently connects users with the perfect real estate agents based on their specific needs and preferences. Think of it as a "matchmaking" system for finding your ideal real estate agent.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: 5-factor scoring system evaluating expertise, performance, availability, location, and specialization
- **Context-Aware**: Recommends agents based on both user profile and current property search
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern Livewire component with visual match scores
- **Fully Tested**: 28 comprehensive test cases
- **Production Ready**: Zero security vulnerabilities, optimized queries

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run Migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This creates:
- `agent_matches` table for storing matches
- `agent_preferences` column in users table

### 2. Basic Usage

```php
use App\Services\AgentMatchingService;

// Get recommended agents for a user
$service = new AgentMatchingService();
$agents = $service->findMatches($user, 5);

// Each agent has a match_score and match_details
foreach ($agents as $agent) {
    echo "{$agent->name}: {$agent->match_score}%\n";
}
```

### 3. Set User Preferences

```php
$user->agent_preferences = [
    'location' => 'New York',
    'property_type' => 'apartment',
    'postal_code' => '10001'
];
$user->save();
```

### 4. Use in Blade Views

```blade
{{-- Display agent recommendations --}}
<livewire:agent-recommendations />

{{-- With specific search context --}}
<livewire:agent-recommendations 
    :searchContext="['location' => 'Boston', 'property_type' => 'condo']" 
/>
```

## 📊 How It Works

The service scores agents across 5 dimensions:

| Factor | Weight | Based On |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Expertise** | 25% | Properties sold, success rate |
| **Performance** | 25% | Client ratings and reviews |
| **Availability** | 20% | Current workload |
| **Location** | 15% | Experience in desired area |
| **Specialization** | 15% | Property type expertise |

**Overall Match Score** = Weighted average of all factors (0-100%)

## 💡 Common Use Cases

### Find Agents for User Profile

```php
// User-specific helper method
$agents = $user->getRecommendedAgents(5);
```

### Generate & Save Matches

```php
// Generate matches with minimum 60% score
$matches = $user->generateAgentMatches(60);

// Access saved matches
$pending = $user->agentMatches()->pending()->get();
$accepted = $user->agentMatches()->accepted()->get();
```

### Property Search Integration

```php
// Recommend agents based on search context
$searchContext = [
    'location' => 'San Francisco',
    'property_type' => 'house',
    'min_price' => 800000,
    'max_price' => 1200000
];

$agents = $user->getAgentsForPropertySearch($searchContext);
```

### Accept/Reject Matches

```php
$match = AgentMatch::find($id);
$match->accept();  // or $match->reject();
```

For complete documentation, see:
- **[AGENT_MATCHING_SERVICE.md](./AGENT_MATCHING_SERVICE.md)** - Full API reference and usage guide
- **[AGENT_MATCHING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](./AGENT_MATCHING_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Technical implementation details

## 🎨 UI Component

The Livewire component provides:
- Visual match score with progress bars
- Match reasons (why this agent?)
- Agent statistics (properties, ratings)
- Contact and profile buttons
- Responsive design

## ⚡ Performance Tips

1. **Eager Loading**: The service automatically eager loads relationships
2. **Team Filtering**: Queries are scoped to user's team for efficiency
3. **Caching**: Consider caching match results for high-traffic scenarios
4. **Background Jobs**: Generate matches via queued jobs for batch processing

## 🔒 Security

- ✅ No SQL injection vulnerabilities (uses Eloquent ORM)
- ✅ Team-based isolation prevents cross-tenant access
- ✅ Input validation on all user data
- ✅ Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria

✅ **Users are matched with agents based on their needs**
- Multi-factor algorithm considers location, property type, price range, etc.
- User preferences stored and used for matching
- Context-aware recommendations adapt to search behavior

✅ **Matches are accurate and helpful**
- Sophisticated 5-factor scoring algorithm
- Human-readable explanations for each match
- Weighted factors prioritize most important attributes
- Base scores ensure new agents aren't excluded

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Customize Scoring**: Adjust weights in `calculateMatchScore()` if needed
2. **Add Preferences UI**: Create form for users to set preferences
3. **Analytics**: Track match acceptance rates
4. **Notifications**: Alert users when new matching agents are available
5. **Agent Dashboard**: Show agents their matched clients
